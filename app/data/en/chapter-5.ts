      text: "In his <em>Letters from Italy</em>, author Ljubomir Nenadović described a new phenomenon that was becoming noticeable within European cities in the mid-19th century. It was the appearance of people traveling &quot;just for the sake of traveling... those eternal wanderers to whom a hotel is a house, an ocean is a lake, Switzerland is a local park, and the entire globe is a fatherland.&quot; When they visit a certain place, they always move forward. &quot;To where? Anywhere! Just not to places they have already been to.&quot; This kind of travel was difficult to imagine in previous centuries and was most similar to a practice known as the <em>Grand Tour</em>, which was very popular among the European aristocracy since the 17th century. It was a curious process of education where young noblemen, followed by tutors or local guides, toured cultural and artistic landmarks in different parts of Europe. Traveling for leisure, as well as visits to spas for relaxation or treatment, over time became a model that the growing middle class tended to adopt during the 19th century.",

      text: "In its initial stages, tourism was intended for the most affluent layers of society, who had both spare time and financial means for carefree voyages. The desire to relax and escape from industrial society drove wealthy tourists, accustomed to comfort, to go on a journey, the goal of which should simultaneously be both <em>accessible and inaccessible, distant from civilization and comfortable at the same time</em>. Ironically, an increase in the number of people seeking peace away from industrial reality gave birth to a new industry that would organize this <em>escape</em> for them.",

Following the example of the earlier explorers, often seen by their contemporaries as vagabonds, numerous adventurists throughout the 19th century looked to fill in the blank areas on world maps and inform the public about these places in their travel writings. Probably the most famous Serbian traveler-adventurist in this period was Milan Jovanović Morski, a doctor and a writer who immortalized his adventures from journeys to Naples, the Middle East, and the Far East in his travel stories.",

      text: "The first half of the 19th century brought the emergence of the first written tour guides. The most famous among them was produced by Karl Baedeker, a publisher from Leipzig, after whom they were named <em>Baedekers</em>. The earliest travel guides had treated traveling like a necessary evil. Therefore, they provided travelers with practical advice, about the best routes, with warnings about potential dangers ahead, while encouraging them to visit the church before the trip and to always carry a loaded gun. Baedekers, on the other hand, offered idyllic portrayals of countries or romantic routes, to motivate travelers to visit those places. Inspired by John Murray, another pioneer in the field of travel guide publishing, Baedeker introduced the star system as a way of classifying landmarks by their splendor and significance. Southeastern Europe was described in a separate Baedeker only in the 20th century. Until then, Serbia was only mentioned in passing as one out of many stops on the journey across the Danube or to Istanbul. The first Serbian travel guide, named <em>A Guide through Belgrade</em>, was published in 1896.",

      text: "With the appearance of travel guides and advancements in means of transportation, solid foundations were laid for the development and standardization of mass tourism. This term refers to prearranged tours for groups of people traveling together with a similar goal, led by professionals in the field of tourism. A key role in promoting and expanding mass tourism was played by the Englishman Thomas Cook, who, in the 1840s, began his activity on preparing the first group arrangements, taking upon himself the organization of transportation, accommodation, daily meals, and program activities for the duration of the trip. With further improvement of vehicles, as well as later reforms that provided workers with a paid vacation, conditions were created for a genuine flourishing of mass tourism in the 20th century.",

They saw travel as an excellent means for expanding one’s horizons and discovering different cultures, with many of them finding inspiration in the life's work of famous Serbian enlightener Dositej Obradović. Authors like Milan Jovanović Morski, Ljubomir Nenadović, Joakim Vujić, Vladan Đorđević, Simo Matavulj, and many others made travel literature about faraway places very popular with the local public. Through adopting European models, traveling became <em>a goal of its own</em> for them. ",

Major efforts were made from the mid-19th century onward in arranging and adapting them to meet the needs of an increasing number of guests. Among the most popular spas in Serbia, we can include Banja Koviljača, Bukovička Banja, Niška Banja, and Vranjska Banja. In the second half of the century, they were increasingly becoming favorite tourist destinations rather than places for healing and recovery.",

Therefore, the practice of shorter excursions became one of the more popular forms of pastime near the end of the 19th century. In the Belgrade surroundings, places like Topčider and Košutnjak became popular spots for relaxation and <em>going out to nature to get fresh air</em>, and, with the expansion of the railroad network, there was a growing number of other, easily reachable places for vacations. By the end of the century, students' excursions also became a regular practice. Cruises were also quite popular, taking travelers to places such as Pančevo, Novi Sad, Sremski Karlovci, etc.",
