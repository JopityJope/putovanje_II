      text: "A traveler least often seen on roads and seas in centuries past was a woman. Although we start with the fact that traveling was very painstaking, slow, and full of dangers, the mobility of women was primarily affected by their social class and the gender role they had in a patriarchal society. The expectation for a woman was to always be with her family and children and to always be at home. Therefore, it was unusual, and often even forbidden, for a woman to go on a trip, especially without an urgent need, and exclusively in the company of a man - her husband, father, or brother. A woman on board, according to the superstition of sailors, was a bad omen and an indicator of imminent doom. Hence, it doesn’t come as a surprise that women have been the most static part of society. Opposite Odysseus, the eternal voyager, the ideal of a woman was Penelope, his faithful wife, patiently waiting for her husband to come home from his journeys.",

      text: "Belonging to a certain class or other specific social circumstances could have allowed certain women to travel. During the Middle Ages, it was possible for noblewomen to travel, though with a mandatory accompaniment and a degree of comfort. Since Serbian rulers spent most of the year traveling across the country, they were followed during these trips by their entire entourage, as well as their wives, accompanied by court ladies. Aside from them, one could also meet female members of monk and beggar orders on the roads, as well as women who embarked on a pilgrimage together with their men. With the Ottoman conquest of Serbia and the consequent migration of parts of the population toward the neighboring Christian states, many women found themselves in temporary shelters with their families.",

      text: "Before the 19th century, traveling was reserved for men. This was, apart from social factors, also influenced by practical obstacles. Travelers were faced with many threats, such as bandits, poorly made roads, storms on the sea, and other predicaments, which all sent clear signals to women that traveling was not for them. The question of privacy while on a trip also presented a specific issue, so women who had the freedom and opportunity to even embark on a journey would need to exert a lot of effort to maintain their intimacy. Miss Irby and Georgina Muir Mackenzie, two British ladies who traveled across the Balkans in the 1860s, recorded a story about how, in &quot;a dirty inn, they were compelled to open their tents&quot; just so they could hide from the eyes of their male companions. </br> In most cases, the male accompaniment was mandatory. Although during the first half of the 19th century, an increasing number of women could be seen on European and Serbian roads, they were usually there in the role of the wife of their traveling companion - a diplomat, wealthy merchant, or banker. This was also noticeable in travel documents, as passports were issued for the husband while her presence was ascertained with the information that the passport carrier was traveling in the company of a wife or the family.",

      text: "Social phenomena like industrialization and the appearance of means of mass transportation, brought about a big change in the field of women's mobility. With the emergence of new jobs in factories, women gained more opportunities to separate from their homes. The migration of the population from villages to towns led to the promotion of professions that were designed primarily for women, so, by the mid-19th century, we could already find teachers, governesses, nurses, and factory workers in both Europe and Serbia. Some of the new professions required certain education, which led to more and more Serbian girls traveling to study abroad.",

      text: "Belonging to a certain social group still played a major role in women's mobility, so, for example, members of the Serbian civil class went increasingly often to spas or on excursions to national parks, monasteries, or important historical sites. In contrast, the absolute majority of women, especially in villages where a more traditional way of life was preserved, remained tied to the land and their household. However, the sprouts of women's mobility represented a major step forward compared to previous centuries. Thanks to them, women were growing into equal participants in <em>The Revolution of Travel</em>, and already by the beginning of the 20th century, they had become ubiquitous on trips by train and ship. Still, it would be wrong to conclude that this was an indicator of the overall emancipation of women. Until the end of World War One, women and their rights remained restricted by a framework of predominantly male perspectives, within which women's travel continued to take place.",
