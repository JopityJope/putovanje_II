      text: "Throughout ancient and medieval times, calamities were a primary motive that drove people to move. The decision to leave home was never easy, since it meant a complete break from the usual routine of life. Furthermore, the legislation of systems of slavery and feudalism prevented the most numerous parts of the population from freely moving. Therefore, only in extraordinary circumstances, when the risk of staying exceeded the risk of moving, would masses of people decide to migrate towards areas they believed would provide them with safety and better living conditions overall. These were the painstaking journeys into the unknown, the final destination of which would eventually become the new home to these people. ",

      text: "After the Ottomans penetrated the Balkan Peninsula, a considerable portion of the Serbian population found itself on the move. Not willing to live under Ottoman rule, many Christians abandoned the conquered areas and began to migrate towards the Adriatic Coast or the lands north of the Sava and Danube Rivers. Such migrations were often encouraged by the Habsburg Monarchy, which offered land and certain privileges to new settlers with the desire to replenish abandoned border areas. This led many Serbian families to move into the territory of what would later be known as the Military Frontier. Hurriedly fleeing their homes, they could only bring along small personal items and livestock. The most dramatic migrations took place after the Austro-Turkish wars in the late 17th and mid-18th centuries, when tens of thousands of Serbs left their homes for good. People were leaving together with the clergy, bringing the remains of medieval Serbian rulers, holy books, icons, and other valuables with them.",

      text: "In Europe, one of the most common features of the second half of the 18th and the entire 19th centuries was the rapid demographic growth, which confronted many countries with the problem of relative overpopulation. Liberated from the restraints of feudalism but without the adequate portion of land that would keep them in place, many young people began to move. With the upswing of the Industrial Revolution, cities emerged as preferred destinations for this fast-growing segment of society, but they were also becoming places of frequent revolutionary turmoil. European governments sought to reduce social tensions by channeling the excess population towards less-inhabited areas, or to the so-called New World across the ocean. The expansion of rail and steamship lines made the entire process easier and provided conditions for millions of people to try to find happiness in places that were thousands of kilometers away from their place of birth. Though massive, these migrations were different from the earlier ones because former coherent groups of travelers were now replaced by a multitude of individuals who, for personal reasons, with or without their families, were embarking on a faraway journey.",

      text: "In the early 19th century, Serbian people faced an entirely different set of problems since many territories they had inhabited for centuries became sparsely populated due to constant migrations, epidemics, and general suffering. Political instability caused by the abuse of power by local Turkish administrators often forced the population to find safety in temporary shelters in forests and other inaccessible areas. The outbreak of the First Serbian Uprising set the local population in motion, swiftly transforming them from a previously rather passive position into soldiers, merchants, diplomats, and administrators of a newly established insurgent state. The collapse of the uprising in 1813 caused the last major exodus of Serbs in the 19th century, when approximately one hundred thousand people, led by the uprising commanders, fled to the territory of the Habsburg Monarchy. Those who remained were subjected to a brutal, vengeful campaign by Turkish soldiers. It was then recorded that the Bosnian vizier, in a conversation with the French consul, stated how the leadership of devastated Serbia would no longer find any people to rebel with. However, after the pacification of the situation and subsequent proclamation of amnesty, a portion of refugees went back to their homes, while others decided to stay in southern Hungary or, like insurgent leaders Karađorđe and Mladen Milovanović, proceeded further towards Russia.",

      text: "The successful outcome of the Second Serbian Uprising and the subsequent establishment of autonomy inside the Ottoman Empire fundamentally changed the migratory routes of the Serbian people. Since the time of the First Serbian Uprising, ties have solidified with compatriots from the Habsburg Monarchy, who began arriving in Serbia in increasing numbers and taking part in the construction of the first state bureaucracy. The laws that were adopted in the 1830s effectively abolished feudalism, giving Serbian peasants the right of ownership over the land they cultivated. The remaining portions of land were offered to Serbs from other regions of the Ottoman Empire, resulting in around 666.000 people moving to Serbia between 1834 and 1874 from Montenegro, Bosnia, and the so-called Old Serbia. However, for Serbs who were still living in areas under direct Ottoman control, the situation didn't change much throughout the 19th century.",

Due to the poor rate of industrialization, it was young, educated people who typically gravitated towards cities, looking for employment in the state apparatus. A larger swing in industrialization and consequent urbanization would not take place in Serbia before the 20th century. ",
