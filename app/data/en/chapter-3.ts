      text: "Older than cities and states, trade has been present since the very beginning of human history and, by its nature, it required the movement of goods, people, and money. Trade hasn't changed its essence to the present day – people were selling goods they had surpluses of and buying those they were lacking. Its main protagonist, the merchant, could have been encountered on every road, in every tavern or port, regardless of the era. Their motives for leaving home, in contrast to most people, weren't conditioned by trying to escape wars or diseases, but rather by lucrative business opportunities. That journey, though filled with dangers, brought success, profits, and prestige. In direct connection with profit-making were the advancements in road infrastructure and the means of transportation, so wealthy merchants increasingly acted as benefactors of road maintenance, the construction of bridges, and shipbuilding.",

      text: "In medieval Serbia, trade was quite extensive. It was best encapsulated by endless caravans of horses and oxen, loaded with goods, slowly moving along dusty roads. Trade links spread across the country, connecting it with coastal cities, with marketplaces popping up at the intersections of roads or close to monasteries and towns. Merchants and their products were protected by law, and trade itself was guaranteed by rulers' charters and contracts. The appearance of the Ottomans brought an end to a long tradition of Serbian commerce, so trade moved into the hands of Turks, Aromanians, Jews, and Vlachs, with a few rare examples of Serbian merchants.",

      text: "When it comes to global trade, it has been on the rise ever since the 16th century. Geographical discoveries and the subsequent creation of colonies were supported and often even sponsored by wealthy merchant families. The expansion of colonialism additionally increased their financial power, which allowed some individuals to move up the social ladder. A merchant became an embodiment of a <em>man of the world</em>, a traveler well-informed about foreign languages and current events in other countries. Therefore, travel became an essential part of every future merchant's education, so sons from tradesman families often went on expeditions along with their fathers. 19th-century industrialization accelerated the development of commerce further, since merchants were increasingly investing in businesses based on industrial production. While factories made the increase in productivity possible, the main drivers of <em>The Revolution of Travel </em>– railways and steamships – enabled them to quickly transport and sell new goods.",

      text: "With the establishment of the autonomous principality in the first half of the 19th century, trade in Serbia fell into the hands of a few prominent people, who, thanks to their ties with Austria and Russia, played a key role in organizing and financing of Serbia's independence struggle. Throughout the century, the Sava and Danube Rivers were used as vital trading routes towards Austria, Wallachia, and the Black Sea, whereas rafts filled with seasonal agricultural products were sent downstream by the Drina River. Land trade was still carried out by caravans, like in previous centuries. A merchant would hire skilled workers (<em>kiridžije</em> and <em>rabadžije</em>) for the transportation needs, who would form the caravan and be responsible for its safety, loading of horses and oxen, direction of travel, selecting places where they would rest along the way, etc.",

      text: "By the mid-century, there were two main types of merchants in Serbia. The first was a wholesaler, with affiliations and businesses in Vienna, Istanbul, Venice, and other trade centers. These rich merchants followed trends in global trade and were the first to embrace the novelties, like railroads and steamships. They were the ones who brought European fashion and new goods to Belgrade and other Serbian cities. Contemporaries noticed that many things that symbolized traditional ways of life were slowly being replaced by their modern European counterparts. However, regardless of how important wholesalers were for the development of the bourgeoisie and the cities, the most common types of merchants in 19th-century Serbia were the traveling salesmen. Often referred to as the <em>baggers</em> after their humble bundles loaded with different small handmade products, they roamed from one village to another and sold cheap goods. Regardless of how much the state tried to put an end to their tax evasion, they managed to preserve this manner of trade until the mid-20th century. The prevalent goals of their wanderings were the local fairs, which were the main trading events in every region of Serbia. ",

      text: "At fairs, one could meet wholesalers with goods from abroad, petty traders with products from different parts of Serbia, as well as baggers with their smaller items. The importance of fairs was also confirmed by Vladimir Karić, who noted that in the 1880s there were a total of 373 fair days in Serbia. The trade eventually became so popular that people started noticing how <em>every devil had become a salesman</em>. But, until the eventual start of industrialization, it came down to resale and speculation, more or less. It was only with the acceleration of this process and the introduction of railroads that a market for consumer society was starting to emerge in Serbia.",
