      text: "With rare merchants, the most mobile part of Serbian society during the period of Ottoman rule were monks and pilgrims. A difficult financial predicament the Serbian Orthodox Church found itself in demanded many monks to spend months and years roaming across the Balkan Peninsula, as well as Wallachia, Moldova, and Russia, to collect financial aid and establish ties with fellow Orthodox nations. Religious feelings have also been a strong incentive for the movement of regular people who, on major holidays, went to the nearby monasteries to attend a holy service. Holly places, such as churches, monasteries, and the ruins of old temples or tombs, played an important role in the life and traditions of the Serbian people. People also went there in times of illness or danger because it was believed that the presence of holy relics kept in those places could provide healing and protection.",

      text: "Much like the monks, pilgrims were also inspired to go on a journey by a deep sense of religious devotion, although the goals of their trips were primarily of a personal nature. A pilgrimage is a trip to a distant holy place normally not visited during a regular liturgical cycle. This form of travel was an act of active piety, and its goal was the salvation of the soul through a stay in places connected to the lives of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the saints. Pilgrimage was also common among nations of different religions. This tradition has been present among Serbian people for centuries and can be traced back to Saint Sava, who was most likely the first among Serbs to &quot;bow down to the lifesaving and life-giving tomb of our Lord Christ,&quot; as was written by his hagiographers Domentijan and Theodosius.",

      text: "Pilgrimage was also widely present among Serbian people during the 19th century. In a certain hierarchy, a visit to the Holy Land and Jerusalem represented the biggest accomplishment, followed by a visit to Mount Athos. For pilgrims with more modest ambitions and capabilities, destinations could have also been places like Studenica, Visoki Dečani, Patriarchate of Peć, Prohor Pčinjski, Ostrog, monasteries of the Fruška Gora Mountain, etc. In this period, literature promoting the pilgrim's journeys, like travel guides through the Holy Land and Mount Athos appeared, and by the end of the century, under the patronage of Russia and Greece, group tours for pilgrims were already starting to be organized. Serbian pilgrims mostly came from wealthier parts of society. It wasn't a rare occasion for rulers to go on such trips themselves, primarily to bow to the remains of Saint Stefan the First-Crowned in Studenica Monastery, which in time took on ideological, state, and national character.",

      text: "The time one would decide to go on a pilgrimage was usually tied to major holidays or special events in a traveler's life. When a devotee would announce in front of the church door his intention to go, priests would invite other people of faith to join him or at least help collect the necessary funds for the journey. The trip itself was a true Christian accomplishment that required significant material and physical sacrifices. The travel was done on foot, riding a horse, or by boat. The longest and most dangerous path to the Holy Land led through Istanbul, Asia Minor, and Syria. A somewhat faster and easier route went from Thessaloniki or Dubrovnik to Alexandria, and from there on, the pilgrims went further to Jerusalem by land. Usually, a group of religious people would decide to participate in such an undertaking together, either by following caravans or going on their own. A question of safety always arose during such expeditions, since pilgrims were often targeted by pirates or bandits, who were aware that anyone who embarks on a journey like this must have plenty of money or other valuables on him. Still, the belief that all the challenges faced during a pilgrimage would bring the pilgrim closer to heaven ultimately had a major influence on their perseverance.",

      text: "The arrival at the holy site presented the culmination of a pilgrim's journey. Newcomers were solemnly received by monks, followed by the sounds of church bells and celebratory gunfire. During their time in the Holy Land, travelers were staying in special residences for pilgrims, where their daily routine and diet closely resembled those of monks. Their spare time was spent on joint prayers, charity work, and visits to nearby holy places. Before returning home, pilgrims acquired various souvenirs, like graphics, special kinds of icons (the so-called <em>jerusalems</em>), prayer beads, candles, clods of Jerusalem land, olive branches, or water from the River Jordan, which they later gifted to friends and clergy or kept as reminders of their own achievements. Upon returning from the pilgrimage, the traveler was named <em>hadžija (hajji)</em>, and the prefix <em>Hadži</em> was added to his last name, which granted him a prominent status in the local community.",

      text: "Like the religious zeal that, for centuries, inspired people of faith to travel, patriotism emerged as a motive for traveling in the 19th century. Similar to minor pilgrimages, these represented travels through local territory, often followed by travel literature, whose main goal was to get to know various places inhabited by certain nations. Such journeys contributed to the feeling of national and spatial cohesiveness because they solidified the bonds between communities that, until then, lived apart with very little mutual communication. These interactions intensified with the expansion of the transportation network, which created fertile soil for many intellectuals to work on the conceptual unification of national spaces. Such a process, highly prevalent in territorially compartmentalized regions like Germany and Italy, was also visible among the Serbian intelligentsia.",

Milićević were <em>drawing the boundaries</em> of the Serbian national space and were keen to spread knowledge about it to future generations. Such forward-thinking endeavors carried a lot of weight because these were the foundations on which new generations would be brought up, to whom the results of their tireless work were intended. The desire to build stronger ties with the past led travelers toward the areas of Old Serbia. Travel literature was filled with powerful impressions about material remains of Serbia's medieval culture and art, monasteries, sites of great battles, and other significant events from the past. Upon liberation, such places became must-see destinations for student excursions, where youth went to be inspired by patriotism and to gain awareness about the history of their nation. ",
