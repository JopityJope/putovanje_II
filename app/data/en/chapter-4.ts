      text: "Certain roles inside state apparatus have always required a high degree of readiness to be on the move, and among them are the likes of soldiers, messengers, and diplomats, whose main motive for traveling wasn't a personal one but rather of an official nature. The earliest known diplomatic mission of the medieval Serbian state dates back to 1188, when Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja sent his emissary to the court of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in Nuremberg. The further development of the medieval state influenced the expansion of its diplomatic activity, only for it to be completely cut off by the Ottoman conquest. It was preserved solely in traces by the Serbian Orthodox Church, whose representatives sporadically kept in touch with other centers of Orthodox Christianity as well as the central government in Istanbul.",

      text: "With the outbreak of the First Serbian Uprising, Serbian diplomacy got a new impulse, and a significant part of the population entered the service of their fatherland, in the roles of soldiers, merchants, clerks, or diplomats. In the early stages of the uprising, by orders of its leader Karađorđe, a diplomatic mission was sent to Zemun and Petersburg to obtain help in future endeavors. The insurgents' successes sparked interest from other European powers in the events taking place on the soil of <em>European Turkey</em>, so as early as 1807, the first official foreign emissary, a Russian Konstantin Rodofinikin, arrived in Serbia. During and after the Second Serbian Uprising, Prince Miloš Obrenović invested a lot of effort in the development of Serbia's diplomacy. Significant are the years 1826, when a special department for the foreign policy of the Public Office was organized, and 1838, when Serbian authorities were allowed to name a permanent diplomatic agent in Istanbul, the so-called <em>kapućehaja</em>. When necessary, Miloš himself took on the role of a diplomat, first during truce negotiations to end the Second Uprising and later with his trip to Istanbul in 1835. His son, Prince Mihailo, followed in his footsteps and went to Istanbul on two occasions: in 1839/40 and 1867.",

      text: "As a relic of Ottoman times, until the establishment of public postal traffic in the 1840s, in the Principality of Serbia operated the so-called <em>Tatar service</em>, which was the predecessor of the modern postal service. <em>Tatar</em> was a colloquial name for horse rider-messenger, whose mission was to quickly and safely deliver letters, documents, money, or other valuables to a designated location. For faster movement, Tatars used special stations (<em>menzulane</em>) where they could rest and replace horses. After the Second Serbian Uprising, these Ottoman stations were replaced by Serbian ones, and as a counterpart to the Tatars, Prince Miloš introduced the courier service in 1815.",

      text: "After gaining autonomy, the Principality of Serbia was faced with the challenge of building modern political institutions. A dominant state model in 19th-century Europe required a substantial bureaucratic apparatus capable of handling complex state affairs. The shortage of educated people who could fulfill such an apparatus was acute in the first half of the 19th century, as a result of the fact that Serbs, like the majority of Balkan nations, entered the century without schools in their native languages. Therefore, during this time, Serbs from the Habsburg Monarchy held most of the clerk positions.",

      text: "In the early 1830s, Prince Miloš occasionally provided scholarships to poorer high school students, sending them to acquire higher education in Wallachia, Russia, or the Habsburg Monarchy. From 1839 onward, this practice took the shape of a planned educational program for Serbian students in foreign countries, with the number of scholarship holders gradually increasing. They, in turn, accepted certain responsibilities, the most important of which was that, after the studies ended, their newly gained knowledge and skills would be put in the service of the state in a position that was designated for them.",

Therefore, throughout the 19th century, the state was a key factor in forming a national elite because only the state had the financial means to pay for people's higher education and suitable jobs for their employment. It was actually the first generation of scholarship holders that formed the first authentic home-grown elite, the so-called <em>sons of the fatherland</em>, who, in time, took over key positions in Serbian society from Austrian Serbs.",

Students were predominantly sent to some of the most prestigious universities in Europe to return home after studies as experts in fields in which Serbian society was deficient. They got their education in Germany, the Habsburg Monarchy, Switzerland, and Russia, while a special place in the intellectual and ideological development of Serbian students belonged to Paris, as a cradle of liberal and romanticist ideas. The first generations of graduates from Paris University, the so-called <em>Parisians</em>, brought many new ideas to the Principality of Serbia, which they later tried to implement through the formation of the first political parties.",

Many of them, upon returning, became professors at the Grand School, a predecessor of the University of Belgrade, where, in the following decades, they taught future Serbian intellectuals and public servants. Yet, an estimate that approximately 70 percent of Serbian intelligentsia throughout the 19th century obtained their education abroad best illustrates just how important this practice was for the young Serbian state, where in 1890 the literacy rate was still only a fraction over 14 percent. Apart from education, society has greatly benefited from the growing number of educated people in the field of science. While traveling across the country, collecting, and systematizing knowledge about geography, history, folklore, and material remains of the past, these hardworking people made an immense contribution to Serbian science and laid the foundations for its further progress.",
